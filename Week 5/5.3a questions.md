# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Clustering Concepts and Approaches

1. **(Easy)** What is the primary goal of clustering in unstructured data analysis?  
A. To assign each document to a single predefined category  
B. To group similar documents or data points into clusters without predefined labels  
C. To translate documents into multiple languages  
D. To count the number of words in each document  

2. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** Which of the following are common types of clustering algorithms?  
A. Centroid-based clustering  
B. Hierarchical clustering  
C. Density-based clustering  
D. Neural network clustering  

3. **(Medium)** What is a key challenge when clustering high-dimensional textual data?  
A. The curse of dimensionality leading to sparse data and difficulty in measuring similarity  
B. Lack of enough data points  
C. Overfitting to training labels  
D. Inability to tokenize text  

4. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which of the following are challenges associated with clustering algorithms?  
A. Interpretability of clusters  
B. Computational expense with large datasets  
C. Instability due to random initialization  
D. Guaranteed perfect cluster assignments  

5. **(Hard)** How does hierarchical clustering differ from centroid-based clustering?  
A. Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters by merging or splitting, centroid-based assumes spherical clusters  
B. Hierarchical clustering requires labeled data, centroid-based does not  
C. Centroid-based clustering is only for images  
D. Hierarchical clustering is faster than centroid-based  

## Section 2: Clustering Model Evaluation and Practical Use

6. **(Medium)** Which distance measure is commonly used in centroid-based clustering?  
A. Cosine similarity  
B. Euclidean distance  
C. Jaccard distance  
D. Manhattan distance  

7. **(Hard)** Why is it difficult to evaluate the quality of clustering results?  
A. Because clusters may not have clear boundaries and evaluation metrics vary by algorithm  
B. Because clustering always produces perfect results  
C. Because clustering requires labeled data  
D. Because all clusters have the same size  

8. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** What are some strategies to improve clustering interpretability?  
A. Reducing dimensionality before clustering  
B. Limiting the number of clusters to a manageable number  
C. Using domain knowledge to label clusters  
D. Ignoring cluster sizes  

9. **(Medium)** What is the effect of the curse of dimensionality on clustering?  
A. It makes all points appear equally distant, reducing meaningful similarity  
B. It increases the number of clusters  
C. It improves cluster separation  
D. It reduces computational time  

10. **(Hard)** Why might clustering be used in conjunction with topic modeling?  
A. To further group documents based on topic distributions  
B. To replace topic modeling entirely  
C. To label documents with sentiment scores  
D. To count word frequencies
