# Answer Key

## Section 1: Clustering Concepts and Approaches

1. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The main goal of clustering is to group similar documents or data points into clusters without predefined labels.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Required: Sort customers into different groups for follow-up" (5.3a.pdf, Scenario)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Centroid-based, hierarchical, and density-based clustering are the three main types described; neural network clustering is not listed.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Clustering Approaches: Centroid-based clustering... Hierarchical clustering... Density-based clustering" (5.3a.pdf, Clustering Approaches)

3. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** High-dimensional data is sparse, making it difficult to measure similarity and cluster effectively.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "High dimensional data presents challenges with clustering: ... 'Curse of High Dimensions'" (5.3a.pdf, Clustering Challenges)

4. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Interpretability, computational expense, and instability due to random initialization are all listed as challenges; perfect assignments are not guaranteed.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Interpretability... Computational requirements... Instability... Hard to evaluate quality" (5.3a.pdf, Clustering Challenges)

5. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters by merging or splitting; centroid-based assumes spherical clusters.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Hierarchical clustering... forms clusters based on finding the most similar pairs... Centroid-based clustering... assumes spherical shape" (5.3a.pdf, Clustering Approaches)

## Section 2: Clustering Model Evaluation and Practical Use

6. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Euclidean distance is the typical measure for centroid-based clustering.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "These types of clustering methods rely on distance between points to group data, and we almost always use Euclidean distance there." (5.3a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

7. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Evaluation is difficult because clusters may not have clear boundaries and metrics vary.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Finally, it can be difficult to evaluate the quality of clusters. The exact measures depend very much on the algorithm." (5.3a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

8. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Reducing dimensionality, limiting the number of clusters, and using domain knowledge all improve interpretability; ignoring cluster sizes does not.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Evaluating clustering models can be very subjective and we often need to balance granularity with interpretability." (5.3a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

9. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** The curse of dimensionality makes all points appear equally distant, reducing meaningful similarity.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "This curse refers to the fact that high dimensional data tends to be very sparse, so everything looks very dissimilar." (5.3a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

10. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Clustering can be used after topic modeling to further group documents based on topic distributions.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "often we'll see these methods stacked on top of one another. So it's very possible to represent your corpus in that document topic matrix, and then further refine it with another algorithm like a clustering method." (5.3a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)
