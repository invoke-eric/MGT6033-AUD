A. It is time-consuming  
B. It can miss rare but important issues  
C. It is always more objective than modeling

3. **(Medium)** What is the impact of poor preprocessing on topic model quality?  
A. It has no effect  
B. It can reduce the interpretability and accuracy of topics  
C. It always increases coherence  
D. It makes the model faster  

4. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which steps are essential in the topic modeling workflow described in the lecture?

## Section 2: Model Tuning, Evaluation, and Communication

6. **(Medium)** What is the role of hyperparameters in topic modeling?  
A. They control aspects of model training and behavior  
B. They are only used for data cleaning  
C. They determine the number of documents  
D. They are irrelevant for model quality
