## Section 2: Evaluating K-means and Clustering Metrics

6. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which metrics can be used to evaluate K-means clustering quality?  
A. Within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)  
B. Calinski-Harabasz index  
C. Davies-Bouldin index  
D. Accuracy score  

7. **(Medium)** What does a silhouette score close to -1 indicate for a data point?  
A. The point is well-matched to its assigned cluster  
B. The point is closer to another cluster than its own  
C. The point is an outlier  
D. The point is a centroid  

8. **(Hard)** What is a potential issue when using K-means with high-dimensional unstructured data?  
A. It always finds the global minimum  
B. It may get stuck in a local minimum due to many peaks and valleys in the loss function  
C. It does not require standardization  
D. It works best with categorical data
