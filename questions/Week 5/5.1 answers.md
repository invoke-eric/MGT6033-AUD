# Answer Key

## Section 1: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

1. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Supervised learning requires labeled data (input and output), while unsupervised learning does not require labels.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Supervised learning has both input and output data. ... In an unsupervised task, there are no labels assigned ahead of time." (5.1-Unsupervised-vs.-Supervised-Tasks.txt)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, C  
**Explanation:** Topic modeling and clustering are unsupervised tasks; sentiment classification and NER are typically supervised.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Two common unsupervised machine learning tasks ... are topic modeling and cluster analysis." (5.1.pdf, Summary)

3. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** X refers to input features, Y to output labels in supervised learning.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "I often think of supervised models as requiring both X and Y data. X is the input or the independent variables, while Y is the output." (5.1-Unsupervised-vs.-Supervised-Tasks.txt)

4. **Correct Answers:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Unsupervised learning organizes data based on features, without labels, and is used to uncover groupings or latent dimensions.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Unsupervised learning refers to tasks requiring the machine learning algorithm to organize the data for us. Organization can include grouping or understanding latent dimensions." (5.1.pdf, Summary)

## Section 2: Topic Modeling vs. Clustering

5. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Topic modeling uncovers latent topics and quantifies their relevance for each document.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The objective of topic modeling is to uncover latent topics or themes across the entire corpus, and then quantify how relevant each topic is for each document." (5.1-Unsupervised-vs.-Supervised-Tasks.txt)

6. **Correct Answers:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Each document can have multiple topics, each with a relevance score, and the number of topics is usually user-determined.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Each document could, and very likely does, discuss multiple topics. ... most procedures will generate a topic relevant score for every single identified topic for each document. ... It is usually up to us to decide what's the minimum score to consider the topic included in that document." (5.1-Unsupervised-vs.-Supervised-Tasks.txt)

7. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Clustering assigns each document to one group; topic modeling allows multiple topic associations per document.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "With clustering, the objective is to categorize entire documents into one specific group. ... The key distinction therefore, is that with topic modeling, each element of the corpus is assigned multiple topics." (5.1-Unsupervised-vs.-Supervised-Tasks.txt)

8. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Topic modeling outputs a set of topics and a relevance score for each topic in each document.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Our topic modeling procedure would identify these different topics, as well as how relevant each was to each document." (5.1-Unsupervised-vs.-Supervised-Tasks.txt)

## Section 3: Practical Considerations and Applications

9. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The instructor recommends considering supervised learning first, as it usually produces better output.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "A good rule of thumb in an unsupervised learning is to first determine if a supervised procedure is possible. If we can train a machine to think like we do, that will almost always produce better output than an unsupervised model." (5.1-Unsupervised-vs.-Supervised-Tasks.txt)

10. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Topic modeling and cluster analysis are common unsupervised tasks for unstructured data.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Two common unsupervised machine learning tasks applied to unstructured data are topic modeling and cluster analysis." (5.1.pdf, Summary)
