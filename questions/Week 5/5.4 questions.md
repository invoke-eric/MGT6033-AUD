## Section 1: Principles and Motivation for Dimensionality Reduction

1. **(Easy)** What is the primary goal of dimensionality reduction in the context of unstructured data?  
A. To increase the number of columns in a dataset to make it more sparse  
B. To reduce the number of variables or columns while preserving important information  
C. To convert categorical data to one-hot encoded data  
D. To convert data from a big sparse matrix to a smaller dense matrix  

2. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are common methods for dimensionality reduction in NLP, as discussed in the lecture?  
A. Embeddings  
B. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
C. t-SNE  
D. UMAP  
E. Bag-of-Words  
F. Topic models (LDA, NMF, LSA)

3. **(Medium)** Why might multiple dimensionality reduction techniques be used together in NLP workflows?  
A. Each method is only valid for a specific language  
B. It speeds up processing time  
C. Combining methods can leverage their strengths for different tasks or stages  
D. It makes the dataset much smaller and easier to interprept  

## Section 2: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

4. **(Medium)** What is the main mathematical approach underlying PCA?  
A. Singular value decomposition and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix  
B. Linear regression  
C. Decision trees  
D. K-means clustering  

5. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** What are advantages of PCA for dimensionality reduction?  
A. Simple and fast to implement  
B. Produces orthogonal (uncorrelated) components  
C. Deterministic results  
D. Removes noise in data  

6. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** What are limitations or disadvantages of PCA?  
A. Difficult to interpret individual components  
B. May lose important edge case variation  
C. Assumes linear relationships  
D. Sensitive to outliers and scale  

## Section 3: Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization

7. **(Medium)** What is the primary use of t-SNE in NLP and data science?  
A. Preprocessing for clustering  
B. Visualization of high-dimensional data  
C. Feature selection  
D. Outlier detection  

8. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** What are limitations of t-SNE according to the lecture?  
A. Not deterministic (can give different results on different runs)  
B. Computationally costly  
C. Not appropriate for most preprocessing  
D. Only works for labeled data  

9. **(Medium)** What is a key advantage of UMAP over t-SNE for dimensionality reduction?  
A. UMAP is more scalable and computationally efficient  
B. UMAP is more interpretable  
C. UMAP only works for images  
D. UMAP always produces the same results as PCA  

10. **(Hard)** Why might UMAP not be suitable for use with distance-based clustering methods after dimensionality reduction?  
A. UMAP does not preserve any structure in the data  
B. UMAP requires labeled data for all points  
C. UMAP always increases dimensionality  
D. UMAPâ€™s non-linear transformation may distort distances, making clusters less meaningful
