# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

1. **(Easy)** What is the key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?  
A. Supervised learning uses only input data; unsupervised learning uses only output data  
B. Supervised learning requires labeled data; unsupervised learning does not require labels  
C. Unsupervised learning always outperforms supervised learning  
D. Both require labeled training sets  

2. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are examples of unsupervised learning tasks in natural language processing?  
A. Topic modeling  
B. Sentiment classification  
C. Clustering  
D. Named entity recognition  

3. **(Hard)** In supervised learning, what are X and Y typically referring to?  
A. X is the output, Y is the input  
B. X is the input (features), Y is the output (labels)  
C. Both X and Y are labels  
D. X is always the document, Y is always the topic  

4. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following statements are true about unsupervised learning?  
A. The algorithm organizes the data based on features  
B. There are no labels provided for the data  
C. It requires a labeled training set  
D. It is used to uncover natural groupings or latent dimensions  

## Section 2: Topic Modeling vs. Clustering

5. **(Easy)** What is the main objective of topic modeling?  
A. Assign each document to a single group  
B. Uncover latent topics or themes across a corpus and quantify their relevance to each document  
C. Predict the sentiment of each document  
D. Label documents with a predefined category  

6. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are characteristics of topic modeling as described in the materials?  
A. Each document can be associated with multiple topics  
B. Each document receives a relevance score for every topic  
C. Each document is assigned only one label  
D. The number of topics is usually determined by the user  

7. **(Hard)** What distinguishes clustering from topic modeling in document analysis?  
A. Clustering assigns each document to only one group, while topic modeling allows multiple topic associations  
B. Clustering is supervised, topic modeling is unsupervised  
C. Topic modeling uses labels, clustering does not  
D. Clustering is only used for images  

8. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** According to the lecture, what are typical outputs of a topic modeling procedure?  
A. A set of topics for the entire corpus  
B. A relevance score for each topic in each document  
C. A single label for each document  
D. A list of all unique words in the corpus  

## Section 3: Practical Considerations and Applications

9. **(Hard)** According to the instructor, what is a good rule of thumb before applying unsupervised learning?  
A. Always use unsupervised learning first  
B. Check if a supervised procedure is possible, as it usually produces better output  
C. Never use supervised learning for text  
D. Use clustering before topic modeling  

10. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are common unsupervised machine learning tasks applied to unstructured data?  
A. Topic modeling  
B. Cluster analysis  
C. Regression  
D. Classification
