# Answer Key

## Section 1: Topic Modeling Concepts and Workflow

1. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Topic modeling helps managers efficiently identify key issues and assign responsibility.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Your specific task is to identify the key issues so the responsibility can be assigned." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Manual/keyword-based approaches are time-consuming, may miss rare issues, and can introduce subjectivity.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The downside of this is that it's extremely time consuming... you might miss them in your sampling... there's still a degree of subjectivity..." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

3. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Poor preprocessing reduces interpretability and model quality.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The quality of the topic model depends heavily on the quality of the input text, making preprocessing very important." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

4. **Correct Answers:** E, A, D, C, B  
**Explanation:** The topic modeling workflow steps are (1) preprocessing, (2) feature extraction, (3) model tuning and evaluation, (4) model selection, and (5) communcating results.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The key steps for topic modeling are as follows. First, all documents must be preprocessed... Next, we must perform feature extraction... Next we must choose our model... Fourth, we must train the model and tune the parameters... Finally, we need a way to communicate results." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

5. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Topic modeling is less subjective and scalable compared to manual coding.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The benefit here is that you can utilize the full corpus of text for identifying themes and the output is less impacted by the specific analyst performing the analysis." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

## Section 2: Model Tuning, Evaluation, and Communication

6. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Hyperparameters control training and model behavior.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Hyperparameters are also important, though those tend to be very model-specific." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

7. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Perplexity, coherence, and word intrusion tasks are all used for evaluating topic model fit.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Often we use something called a perplexity score... The higher the value for the score, the more likely the topic is coherent... One great one is called a word intrusion task." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

8. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** High coherence means the topic contains words that belong together and make sense.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The higher the value for the score, the more likely the topic is coherent or includes words that belong together." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

9. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Word intrusion tasks test if humans can spot an unrelated word, indicating topic coherence.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The way this works is that for each topic, you may identify four words relevant to the topic and then you add one randomly chosen word which is the intruder. Individuals then review these short lists of words and try to identify which one does not belong." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)

10. **Correct Answers:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Visualizing topic prominence, showing topic relevance, and analyzing topic similarities are effective communication methods.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "There are some nice visualization techniques we can use to convey both topic prominence in the corpus as well as topic relevance to each document. We can also use something called topic similarities to understand which topics appear alongside each other with greater frequency." (5.2a-Cluster-Analysis-Overview-General-Approaches.txt)
