# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Document-Term Matrix (DTM) Fundamentals

1. **(Easy)** What is a document-term matrix (DTM) in NLP?  
A. A table where each cell stores the definition of a word  
B. A vector-space representation of a corpus of text  
C. A list of grammar rules for natural language  
D. A series of translations between languages  

2. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** Which of the following are possible representations of values in a DTM?  
A. Word counts  
B. TF-IDF  
C. Word vectors  
D. Frequency ranks  

3. **(Hard)** What is typically the most common value in a sparse document-term matrix?  
A. One  
B. The mean value  
C. Zero  
D. The highest word count  

4. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** What information can you directly obtain from a DTM by summing rows or columns?  
A. Document length  
B. Most popular words in the corpus  
C. Unique vocabulary size  
D. Document similarity  

## Section 2: Vocabulary, Sparsity, and Efficiency

5. **(Hard)** Why is vocabulary selection important when constructing a DTM?  
A. It determines which words become columns in the matrix  
B. It prevents the DTM from being dense and computationally inefficient  
C. It ensures rare and common words are treated the same  
D. It improves the accuracy of word vectors  

6. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** What are advantages of sparse matrices in the context of DTMs?  
A. They require less memory to store  
B. They enable efficient computation  
C. They allow for faster tokenization  
D. They are easier to interpret visually  

## Section 3: Sentiment Analysis Approaches and Challenges

7. **(Easy)** What does sentiment analysis primarily attempt to measure in text?  
A. Linguistic complexity  
B. Tone or polarity (positive/negative)  
C. Grammatical correctness  
D. Average document length  

8. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** Which of the following are broad classes of sentiment analysis approaches?  
A. Dictionary-based  
B. Pattern-based  
C. Machine learning-based  
D. Neural translation-based  

9. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** What are challenges of dictionary-based sentiment analysis?  
A. Failure to account for negation (e.g., "not good")  
B. Difficulty interpreting context or modifiers  
C. Inability to process large corpora  
D. Dependence on the quality of the underlying dictionary  

## Section 4: Beyond Basic Sentiment â€“ Other Language Attributes

10. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which of the following can be measured by adapting sentiment analysis methods, according to the lecture?
