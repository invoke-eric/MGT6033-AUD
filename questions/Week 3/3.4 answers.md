# Answer Key

## Section 1: Named Entity Recognition (NER) Concepts

1. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** NER is primarily used to identify and categorize key information such as names, places, or products in text.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Broadly, it's a task of identifying and categorizing key information in the same way."  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Customer support, resume review, and IT assignments are all practical business uses given in the lecture.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Practically, there are many applications, customer support, IT assignment, human resources, those are just a few examples."  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

3. **Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Named entities are specific objects of interest such as people, locations, organizations, or products.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The key information are the named entities we seek to identify. ...unique individuals, products, places..."  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

4. **Correct Answers:** A, D  
**Explanation:** NER output includes categorized entities and possibly associations (e.g., product and section) but not sentiment or grammar correction.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “On the right, you can see how the NER model flags certain pieces of information. ...Mac OS and Windows 11 are correctly identified as products.”  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

## Section 2: NER Methods and Process

5. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** The NER process involves detecting and then categorizing named entities.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "There are two primary steps in NER. First, the named entity is detected. Second, the entities are categorized."  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

6. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** The three NER approaches are lexicon-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "There are three main types of approaches to Named Entity Recognition... lexicon-based approach... rule-based... machine-learning based approach..."  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

7. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Lexicon-based approaches use a pre-prepared dictionary to match entity names.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "First, a lexicon based approach uses a pre-prepared lexicon or dictionary to match chunks of texts with entity names."  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

8. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Rule-based approaches are effective when entities follow well-defined textual patterns.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "A rules-based approach uses predefined rules to extract information in a given text."  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

## Section 3: NER Limitations and Best Practices

9. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Lexicon approaches struggle with novel, misspelled, or ambiguous entities; they do not always require large labeled sets.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The downside of this approach is it's difficult to identify new entities..." and "entities with multiple meanings"  
(*3.4-Named-Entity-Recognition.txt*)

10. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The best NER models often achieve over 90% accuracy.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "most widely used NER models achieve very good accuracy, like 90% or more."
