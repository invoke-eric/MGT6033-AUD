# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Model Training, Tuning, and Parameters

1. **(Easy)** What is the main distinction between model training and model tuning in supervised learning?  
A. Training selects the best hyperparameters; tuning learns model parameters  
B. Training learns model parameters; tuning selects the best hyperparameters  
C. Both refer to the same process  
D. Training is only used for unsupervised models  

2. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are characteristics of model training in machine learning?  
A. Iterative process  
B. Stops at convergence or when parameters stabilize  
C. Involves learning parameters to best fit the data  
D. Only uses closed-form solutions like OLS  

3. **(Medium)** Why do machine learning models for NLP typically require iterative training instead of a closed-form solution?  
A. They have more parameters than equations  
B. They are always linear  
C. They only use binary features  
D. They require labeled data  

4. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are true about hyperparameters in supervised models?  
A. Hyperparameters are set ahead of time, not learned from data  
B. Hyperparameters can control the training process  
C. The value of k in k-means is a hyperparameter  
D. Hyperparameters are always optimized automatically  

5. **(Hard)** What is the main purpose of model tuning in supervised learning?  
A. To find the best combination of hyperparameters for model performance  
B. To increase the number of features  
C. To guarantee perfect accuracy  
D. To remove all bias from the model  

## Section 2: Model Evaluation, Metrics, and Bias

6. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which metrics are commonly used to evaluate regression-type supervised models?  
A. Mean squared error (MSE)  
B. Root mean squared error (RMSE)  
C. Mean absolute error (MAE)  
D. R-squared  

7. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** Which metrics are commonly used to evaluate classifier-type supervised models?  
A. Accuracy  
B. Precision  
C. Recall  
D. F1-score  

8. **(Hard)** Why can a highly accurate classification model still be biased?  
A. It may perform well on the majority class but poorly on the minority class  
B. High accuracy always means low bias  
C. Bias only occurs in regression models  
D. Precision and recall are always equal  

9. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** What is the difference between precision and recall in a binary classification context?  
A. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives  
B. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives  
C. Precision is always higher than recall  
D. Recall is always lower than accuracy  

10. **(Hard)** What is a recommended strategy for dealing with class imbalance and bias in supervised model training?  
A. Assign greater weights to observations from the minority class  
B. Ignore the minority class  
C. Only use accuracy to evaluate the model  
D. Remove all negative samples
