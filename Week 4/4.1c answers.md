# Answer Key

## Section 1: Character Classes and Inversion

1. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `\s` matches any whitespace character, including spaces, newlines, and non-breaking spaces.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Whitespace includes, as you might expect, a space, but it also includes things like new line characters, line breaks, non-breaking spaces, and so forth." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Capital letters invert shorthand classes (e.g., `\S`), and a caret inside brackets inverts custom classes (e.g., `[^aeiou]`).  
**Verbatim Quote:** "To invert this class, you would simply use a capital S or backslash capital S instead of backslash lowercase S. ... To invert, we use the caret at the beginning of the class definition, as I show here with a non-vowel class." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)

3. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `\w` matches letters, numbers, and underscores.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Word like text, which we denote with a slash W ... you're looking for letters, numbers, and then underscores as well." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)

## Section 2: Positional Characters, OR Operator, and Anchors

4. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `^` is the anchor for the start of a string.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "To search for an expression at the beginning of the string, you use a carrot." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)

5. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** The OR operator allows for alternatives and can be used both inside and outside parentheses.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The OR operator is the vertical pipe ... It allows you to introduce flexibility ... You can also use the OR operator to allow for two different groups, not just two different expressions." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)

## Section 3: Greedy vs. Lazy Matching

6. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Greedy quantifiers match as much as possible; lazy quantifiers match as little as possible.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "The greedy version wants to consume as much as possible. The Lazy version is trying to do as little as possible." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)

7. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** *, +, and {a,b} can all be made lazy by adding a `?` after them.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Greedy and lazy modifiers only apply to our two repeaters or operators; the Asterix, the Plus, and then the custom repeaters that we can use braces for. ... we will say Asterix question mark." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)

## Section 4: Look Arounds and Dynamic Group Referencing

8. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Positive lookahead requires a pattern to follow but does not include it in the match.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Pos. Look-ahead: ?=..." (4.1c.pdf)

9. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** `(\1)` matches whatever was captured by the first group, enabling dynamic group referencing.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Fourth, and this is the dynamic match, match again, whatever was in Group 1. We note this with backslash 1..." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)

10. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Dynamic group references allow you to match repeated words or patterns in text.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Dynamic group matching like this may seem like something that doesn't have a lot of applications ... but in the cases when I do need to do something like this, there really is no work around." (4.1c-Regular-Expressions-Building-More-Complex-Expressions.txt)
