# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Regular Expressions in Sentiment Dictionary Cleaning

1. **(Easy)** Why are regular expressions useful when cleaning sentiment dictionary entries?  
A. They allow you to match and manipulate patterns in text efficiently  
B. They sort words alphabetically  
C. They remove all punctuation by default  
D. They convert all text to uppercase  

2. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** Which regular expression patterns could be used to identify dictionary entries like "accord Number 2"?  
A. `Number \d+`  
B. `\d+$`  
C. `\w+ Number \d+`  
D. `^[A-Z]`  

3. **(Medium)** In the context of the sentiment dictionary, what is the purpose of splitting on the "Number" sign or a number at the end of a word?  
A. To remove duplicate or variant entries and keep only the root word  
B. To count the number of positive words  
C. To identify stop words  
D. To convert numbers to words  

4. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which regular expression components can help you extract the root word from entries like "accord Number 5"?  
A. Parentheses for grouping  
B. `split()` with a regex pattern  
C. Matching sequences of letters before "Number"  
D. Anchors to ensure the pattern is at the end of the string  

5. **(Hard)** Why might you need to cast all imported dictionary entries to string before applying regular expressions?  
A. To avoid errors when using string methods like split or lower  
B. To ensure numbers and booleans are treated as text  
C. Because regular expressions only operate on strings  
D. All of the above  

## Section 2: Regular Expressions and DataFrame Operations

6. **(Medium)** What is the effect of using a regular expression to filter out entries with a number at the end of the word in a DataFrame?  
A. It removes variant forms and keeps only the main word  
B. It sorts the DataFrame  
C. It removes all words shorter than five letters  
D. It changes the DataFrame index  

7. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** Which pandas string methods can be used with regular expressions for cleaning sentiment dictionary entries?  
A. `.str.contains()`  
B. `.str.replace()`  
C. `.str.split()`  
D. `.str.upper()`  

8. **(Hard)** When using `.str.split('Number')` on a string like "accord Number 2", what will the result be?  
A. A list with "accord" and " 2"  
B. A single string "accord Number 2"  
C. An integer 2  
D. Only the number 2  

9. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Why might you use a regular expression to match only alphabetic root words in a sentiment dictionary?  
A. To standardize entries for matching with review tokens  
B. To ignore variant numbers and suffixes  
C. To improve accuracy when counting positive/negative words  
D. To remove all capital letters  

10. **(Hard)** What is a potential pitfall if you do not use regular expressions or string splitting to clean dictionary entries before matching them to review text?  
A. Many valid matches will be missed due to mismatched formats  
B. The DataFrame will become corrupted  
C. All positive words will be counted as negative  
D. The review ratings will be overwritten
