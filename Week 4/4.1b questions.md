# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Regular Expression Operators and Match Patterns

1. **(Easy)** Which of the following is a key guideline when using the dot (`.`) operator in regular expressions?  
A. Use it to match only numbers  
B. Use it sparingly, as it matches any character  
C. Always combine it with a plus sign  
D. Only use it at the end of a pattern  

2. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which regular expression operators are used to specify repetition of character classes or groups?  
A. +  
B. *  
C. ?  
D. {a,b}  
E. $  

3. **(Hard)** What is the main reason to use escape characters (backslash `\`) liberally in regular expressions?  
A. Escapes are required for all letters  
B. Escapes prevent special characters from being treated as operators  
C. Escapes make the regex case-insensitive  
D. Escapes are only needed for digits  

4. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** In the provided domain name pattern, which character classes are allowed in a domain label?  
A. Letters  
B. Numbers  
C. Hyphens  
D. Underscores  

5. **(Hard, Select all that apply)** Why is the `\w` character class not suitable for matching domain labels in web addresses?  
A. It does not include numbers  
B. It does not include hyphens  
C. It includes underscores, which are not allowed in domain names  
D. It is case-sensitive  

## Section 2: Building and Grouping Patterns

6. **(Medium)** What is the purpose of using parentheses in a regular expression pattern?  
A. To escape special characters  
B. To create match groups and apply operators to sequences  
C. To match only digits  
D. To force the pattern to start at the beginning of a line  

7. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** In the example web address pattern, which components are made optional or repeatable using regular expression operators?  
A. The transfer protocol (http/https)  
B. The domain label sequence  
C. The subfolder/page path  
D. The top-level domain (e.g., .com)  

8. **(Hard)** What is the effect of placing a `?` after the "s" in "https?" in the protocol pattern?  
A. It makes the "s" required  
B. It makes the "s" optional, matching both "http" and "https"  
C. It matches only "https"  
D. It matches only "http"  

9. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** Why are word boundaries (`\b`) used at the start and end of the full web address pattern?  
A. To ensure the match is a complete word or address  
B. To prevent matching addresses with illegal characters  
C. To restrict matches to the beginning of a line  
D. To avoid partial matches within longer strings  

10. **(Hard)** What is a practical reason for testing regular expressions at a site like regex101.com?  
A. It automatically writes the regex for you  
B. It provides instant feedback and highlights matches, helping you debug patterns  
C. It only works for Python regex  
D. It guarantees perfect matches in all programming languages
