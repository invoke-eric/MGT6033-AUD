# Answer Key

## Section 1: Regular Expressions in Sentiment Dictionary Cleaning

1. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Regular expressions allow efficient matching and manipulation of text patterns, which is essential for cleaning dictionary entries.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Well use a little bit of string methods here. Im going to split on my side...And then finally, Im going to get the lowercase version of all these words..." (3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- `#\d+` matches a hash followed by one or more digits (e.g., "#2").  
- `\d+$` matches one or more digits at the end of a string (e.g., the "2" in "ACCORD#2").  
- `\w+#\d+` matches a word followed by a hash and digits (e.g., "ACCORD#2").  
- `^[A-Z]` only matches a single uppercase letter at the start and is not suitable for this use.  
**Verbatim Quote:**  
"So accord Number 2, accord Number 3, accord Number 5...those words appear multiple times in the dictionary."  
(*3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt*)

3. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:**  
Splitting on "#" or a trailing number removes variant forms and keeps only the root word for matching with review tokens.  
**Verbatim Quote:**  
"So what I want to do is get rid of the latter part of the token. Well use a little bit of string methods here. Im going to split on my side."  
(*3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt*)

4. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D  
**Explanation:**  
- Parentheses can capture groups in regex for extracting the root word.  
- `split()` with a regex pattern allows splitting on the hash or number.  
- Matching sequences of letters before "#" isolates the root word.  
- Anchors (like `$`) can ensure the pattern is at the end of the string.  
**Verbatim Quote:**  
"I'm going to split this word here. And then I'm going to keep the first part Element 0."  
(*3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt*)

5. **Correct Answer:** D  
**Explanation:** All are correct; casting to string ensures compatibility with regex and string methods.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "All we have to do is explicitly cast everything to a string. So we can do this with this string function here." (3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt)

## Section 2: Regular Expressions and DataFrame Operations

6. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Filtering out entries with numbers at the end keeps only the main word, improving match accuracy.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "If I look for accord Number 2, thats never going to match in my sample of reviews. So what I want to do is get rid of the latter part of the token." (3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt)

7. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** `.str.contains()`, `.str.replace()`, and `.str.split()` can all use regex for cleaning.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Well use a little bit of string methods here. Im going to split on my side..." (3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt)

8. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** The result is a list: ["accord", " 2"].  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Im going to split this word here. And then Im going to keep the first part Element 0." (3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt)

9. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Matching only alphabetic root words helps standardize entries, ignore variants, and improve accuracy.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "And then finally, Im going to get the lowercase version of all these words because I know my document term matrix is lowercase." (3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt)

10. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Without cleaning, many valid matches will be missed due to mismatched formats.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "If I look for accord Number 2, thats never going to match in my sample of reviews." (3_DemoB4_Sentiment_Analysis.txt)
