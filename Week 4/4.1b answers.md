# Answer Key

## Section 1: Regular Expression Operators and Match Patterns

1. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The dot matches any character, so it should be used sparingly to avoid unintended matches.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Use the dot, ., sparingly. Recall that the dot matches everything." (4.1b-Regular-Expressions-Building-Match-Patterns.txt)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D  
**Explanation:** +, *, ?, and {a,b} are all repetition operators in regex; $ is an anchor, not a repetition operator.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Apply key regular expression operators (e.g., +, *, ?, {a,b}, etc.)" (4.1b.pdf, Learning Objectives)

3. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Escapes prevent special characters from being treated as regex operators; using them liberally avoids errors.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Be liberal with escapes (\). Using an escape where one is not needed does no harm." (4.1b-Regular-Expressions-Building-Match-Patterns.txt)

4. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Domain labels can have letters, numbers, and hyphens, but not underscores.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Labels can have letters, numbers, and/or hyphens, but cannot start or end with hyphen." (4.1b.pdf, Example: Write a pattern to identify web addresses)

5. **Correct Answers:** B, C  
**Explanation:** `\w` includes underscores (not allowed in domains) and does not include hyphens (which are allowed).  
**Verbatim Quote:** "\w includes a-z and 0-9, but not “-”. \w also includes underscore, which is not allowed." (4.1b.pdf, Building the Pattern)

## Section 2: Building and Grouping Patterns

6. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Parentheses create match groups and allow operators to apply to entire sequences.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Groups are established with parentheses. Allow operators to apply to sequence of characters." (4.1b.pdf, RegEx Groups)

7. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** The protocol is made optional (?), domain labels repeat (+), and subfolders repeat (*) in the pattern.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Group 1: Optional (?), Group 2: One or more (+), Group 5: Zero or more (*)" (4.1b.pdf, Full Expression)

8. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The question mark makes the "s" optional, so both "http" and "https" are matched.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "So, hypertext is that HTTP protocol. Most websites now will use HTTPS. So we could write the pattern like this, https://. However, the S is technically optional or not in all web addresses. ... all we have to do is put a question mark after s like this. This will now match both http//: or https://." (4.1b-Regular-Expressions-Building-Match-Patterns.txt)

9. **Correct Answers:** A, D  
**Explanation:** Word boundaries ensure complete matches and prevent partial matches within longer strings.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Would match without word boundaries! ... I did this testing at the web addressed regex101.com." (4.1b.pdf, Full Expression)

10. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Regex101.com provides instant feedback and highlights matches, making debugging easier.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "This is a great resource for testing regular expressions, and I encourage you to explore it on your own. ... The site will illustrate how matching works." (4.1b-Regular-Expressions-Building-Match-Patterns.txt)
