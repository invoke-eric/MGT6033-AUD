B. Sum the counts for those columns across each row  
C. Reset the DataFrame index  
D. Merge with the original review ratings  

8. **(Hard)** What problem can arise if you drop missing reviews but do not reset the DataFrame index before assigning the tone variable?  
A. The tone Series and DataFrame indices may not align  
B. The DataFrame will be sorted incorrectly  
C. All tone values will be set to zero  
D. The review text will be deleted  

9. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** What are valid ways to realign the tone variable with the original DataFrame after index misalignment?  
A. Set the tone Series index to match the DataFrame index  
B. Reset the DataFrame index  
C. Use `.values` to align by position  
D. Drop all reviews with missing tone  

10. **(Hard)** What is the effect of using `.values` when assigning a Series to a DataFrame column?  
A. It aligns values by position, ignoring the index  
B. It sorts the DataFrame alphabetically  
C. It removes all NaN values  
D. It merges based on the "entry" column  

## Section 3: Interpreting and Validating Sentiment Scores

11. **(Medium)** What is a recommended way to check if calculated tone scores are reasonable?  
A. Sort reviews by tone and inspect the most positive and most negative reviews  
B. Remove all reviews with neutral tone  
C. Only look at the mean tone value  
D. Ignore reviews with missing values  

12. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** What are possible causes for missing or NaN values in the tone variable?  
A. Reviews with zero length after tokenization  
B. Reviews written in unsupported formats  
C. Tokenization procedures that fail to extract words  
D. Reviews with only stop words or punctuation  

13. **(Hard)** Why might a review with a five-star rating have a negative tone score?

B. The review is missing a title  
C. The review contains only punctuation  
D. The review is in a different language  

14. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** How can you use the correlation between tone and review rating to evaluate your sentiment analysis?  
A. A positive correlation suggests tone aligns with ratings  
B. A low or negative correlation may indicate issues with the dictionary or cleaning  
C. Correlation can help validate the effectiveness of the sentiment measure  
D. Correlation is not useful for this purpose  

15. **(Hard)** Why is it important to inspect the actual review text for the most extreme tone scores?  
A. To ensure the sentiment measure matches human intuition  
B. To identify possible errors in cleaning or matching  
C. To improve future dictionary or model adjustments  
D. To remove all positive reviews
