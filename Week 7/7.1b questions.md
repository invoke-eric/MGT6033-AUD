## Section 1: Design Considerations for Neural Networks in NLP

1. **(Easy)** What is a key challenge of traditional text representations like bag-of-words and TF-IDF for neural networks?

B. Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT)  
C. Bag-of-words  
D. TF-IDF  

3. **(Hard)** Why is it important to consider casing (uppercase/lowercase) when preparing text for an ANN?  
A. Cased words can capture semantic differences and improve performance with enough data  
B. Lowercasing always improves performance  
C. Casing is only relevant for numbers

D. The color of the computer  

6. **(Hard)** What is the role of zero padding and truncation in sequence modeling for NLP?  
A. To ensure all input sequences are the same length for the model  
B. To reduce model accuracy  
C. To remove stop words  
D. To convert numbers to text  

7. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which strategies help mitigate overfitting in high-dimensional neural network models for NLP?

B. They have unlimited memory  
C. They require no programming  
D. They are only for graphics  

## Section 3: Evaluation and Ethical Considerations

9. **(Medium)** Why is the choice of evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) important in neural network training?  
A. The metric determines how model performance is monitored and optimized  
B. The metric changes the model architecture  
C. Metrics are only used for regression  
D. Metrics are not important for NLP

A. Model bias can be replicated from training data  
B. Sensitive terms can be masked during preprocessing  
C. Feature importance and synthetic data can be used to test for bias  
D. Model predictions should always be interpreted as deterministic
