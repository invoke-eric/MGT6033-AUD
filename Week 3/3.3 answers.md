# Answer Key

## Section 1: Document-Term Matrix (DTM) Fundamentals

1. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** A DTM is a vector-space representation of a corpus, where rows are documents and columns are tokens.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “We can define the document-term matrix as the vector space representation of a corpus of documents.” (3.3-Sentiment-Analysis.txt)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** DTMs can represent word counts, TF-IDF, and word vectors (though word vectors aren’t a “true DTM” but are listed).  
**Verbatim Quote:** “Possible representations: Counts, TF-IDF, Word Vectors” (3.3.pdf, The Document-Term Matrix slide)

3. **Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Most values in DTMs are zero, as most words do not appear in most documents.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “In a sparse matrix, one value is by far the most common...What value do you think this would be in a DTM? Zero.” (3.3-Sentiment-Analysis.txt)

4. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Row sums give document length; column sums give word popularity.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “A row sum gives you document length and a column sum tells you how popular a given word is in the matrix.” (3.3-Sentiment-Analysis.txt)

## Section 2: Vocabulary, Sparsity, and Efficiency

5. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** The vocabulary identifies which words become matrix columns and how the dimensions are constructed.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “The vocabulary of a corpus is the list of unique words used in all documents… columns are defined by tokens…” (3.3-Sentiment-Analysis.txt)

6. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Sparse matrices are efficient for storage and computation.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “Sparse matrices are very nice because we can represent them in a very memory-efficient manner.” (3.3-Sentiment-Analysis.txt)

## Section 3: Sentiment Analysis Approaches and Challenges

7. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Sentiment analysis quantifies favorability, i.e., the tone or polarity, of text.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “Sentiment analysis refers to the class of techniques used to classify language based on some underlying dimension, which is often the positivity or negativity of language.” (3.3.pdf, Summary slide)

8. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** The lecture lists dictionary-based, pattern-based, and machine learning-based approaches.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “There are three broad classes to sentiment approaches. The first is dictionary-based… pattern-based … machine learning-based classification…” (3.3-Sentiment-Analysis.txt)

9. **Correct Answers:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Dictionary approaches may fail on negation, context, and are limited by dictionary quality.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “The dictionary approach… will not account for modifiers or context… unless my procedure is very careful… I may misclassify.” (3.3-Sentiment-Analysis.txt)

## Section 4: Beyond Basic Sentiment – Other Language Attributes

10. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D  
**Explanation:** The lecture states that uncertainty, toxicity, financial sentiment, and topic identification can be measured with similar tools.  
**Verbatim Quote:** “Sentiment...but similar tools can capture a variety of textual features. Examples: Uncertainty, Toxicity, Financial sentiment, Topic identification.” (3.3.pdf, Other Language Attributes slide)
