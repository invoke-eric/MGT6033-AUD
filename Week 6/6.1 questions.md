# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Supervised Learning Fundamentals

1. **(Easy)** What is the key distinction between regression-type and classification-type supervised problems?  
A. The number of features in X  
B. Whether the output variable Y is continuous or discrete  
C. The amount of data available  
D. Whether the model uses text or numbers  

2. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are examples of regression-type supervised learning problems in NLP?  
A. Predicting future sales based on text data  
B. Predicting group membership from document content  
C. Predicting stock returns using news articles  
D. Predicting whether a press release signals firm failure  

3. **(Medium)** In supervised learning, what is the primary risk that can cause a model to perform well on training data but poorly on new data?  
A. Underfitting  
B. Overfitting  
C. Data normalization  
D. Cross-validation  

4. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** Which strategies are discussed as ways to avoid or detect overfitting in supervised models?  
A. Use a hold-out sample for evaluation  
B. Employ cross-validation  
C. Reduce model complexity  
D. Always use all available features  

5. **(Hard)** Why is it important to avoid contaminating the hold-out sample in supervised learning?  
A. It ensures the model can be trained more quickly  
B. It allows for a true assessment of out-of-sample predictive power  
C. It increases the training set size  
D. It guarantees perfect accuracy  

## Section 2: Model Training Workflow and Best Practices

6. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** What are the essential steps for training a supervised model, as outlined in the lecture?  
A. Preprocess and prepare the data  
B. Select the model(s)  
C. Split data into training and hold-out sets  
D. Train with cross-validation  
E. Evaluate model fit  

7. **(Hard)** Why might random splitting of data for training and hold-out sets be inappropriate in some cases?  
A. It always leads to overfitting  
B. Similar observations (e.g., from the same company or time period) may end up in both sets, contaminating the hold-out sample  
C. It increases the variance of the model  
D. It is never used in practice  

8. **(Medium)** What is the purpose of cross-validation during model training?  
A. To increase the training set size  
B. To minimize the impact of data-specific nuances on model parameters  
C. To reduce the number of features  
D. To guarantee perfect model fit  

9. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are common methods for reducing model complexity to avoid overfitting?  
A. Feature selection  
B. Removing irrelevant features  
C. Limiting polynomial degree  
D. Adding more noise to the data  

10. **(Hard)** According to the lecture, what should always be included when evaluating model fit for regression-type supervised problems?  
A. Only the training accuracy  
B. Metrics such as mean-squared error or R-squared, and expert judgment on feature importance  
C. The number of features in the model  
D. The number of cross-validation folds
