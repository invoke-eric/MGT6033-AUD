# Answer Key

## Section 1: Model Training, Tuning, and Parameters

1. **Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Training is the process of learning model parameters; tuning is the process of selecting the best hyperparameters.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Model training is the process by which the model learns the parameters that best fit the data... Model tuning involves evaluating different combinations of hyperparameters." (6.2-TuningSupervised-Models-And-Evaluating-Model-Fit.txt)

2. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Model training is iterative, stops at convergence, and involves learning parameters; it does not always use closed-form solutions.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Model training... iterative... stops at convergence... learns the parameters that best fit the data." (6.2.pdf, Training & Tuning Supervised Models)

3. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Machine learning models often have more parameters than equations, so no closed-form solution exists.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "In machine learning models, we have more parameters than equations, so there is no closed-form solution." (6.2-TuningSupervised-Models-And-Evaluating-Model-Fit.txt)

4. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** Hyperparameters are set ahead of time, can control training, and include values like k in k-means; they are not always optimized automatically.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Hyperparameters... are features of the model that are set ahead of time... k in k means clustering is a hyperparameter." (6.2-TuningSupervised-Models-And-Evaluating-Model-Fit.txt)

5. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Model tuning aims to find the best hyperparameters for model performance.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Model tuning involves evaluating different combinations of hyperparameters... to decide which combination is best." (6.2-TuningSupervised-Models-And-Evaluating-Model-Fit.txt)

## Section 2: Model Evaluation, Metrics, and Bias

6. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D  
**Explanation:** MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared are all used to evaluate regression-type models.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Regression-type models: Error-based scores (MSA, MAE, RMSE, etc.) Explained variance (R-squared, Adjusted R-squared)" (6.2.pdf, Evaluating Model Fit)

7. **Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D  
**Explanation:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are all important metrics for classifier-type models.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Classifier-type models: Accuracy (% Correct), Precision, Recall, F1-score" (6.2.pdf, Evaluating Model Fit)

8. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** High accuracy can mask bias if the model performs poorly on the minority class.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "This model is very biased because it performs very poorly in one class relative to the other... But that model has very high accuracy, 99.5% of the time it's correct." (6.2-TuningSupervised-Models-And-Evaluating-Model-Fit.txt)

9. **Correct Answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Precision is true positives over predicted positives; recall is true positives over actual positives.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Precision is... the number of true positives over total classified positives... Recall... is how many of a given class the model correctly identifies or remembers." (6.2-TuningSupervised-Models-And-Evaluating-Model-Fit.txt)

10. **Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Assigning greater weights to minority class observations can help address class imbalance and bias.  
**Verbatim Quote:** "Specifically, we can weight certain observations more heavily if they come from the minority class..." (6.2-TuningSupervised-Models-And-Evaluating-Model-Fit.txt)
